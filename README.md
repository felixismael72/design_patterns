# Design Patterns

Welcome to this Design Patterns Repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing the implementation of design patterns outlined in the seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides). All implementations are written in Java.

This is a work in progress, so feel free to reach out and correct me if you feel that something is misrepresented in here. :) 

This content also takes into account the knowledge exposed by the [Refactoring Guru website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a practical exploration of various design patterns, fostering a deeper understanding of their principles and applications. By encapsulating client code and design pattern implementations within organized packages, this repository aims to offer clear and accessible examples for developers to learn from.

## Structure

The repository is structured into three main categories based on the classification of design patterns:

- **Creational**: Patterns focusing on object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural**: Patterns that deal with object composition and structure.
- **Behavioral**: Patterns that address communication between objects and responsibilities.

Within each category, individual design patterns are implemented in their respective packages, ensuring a logical organization for easy navigation and reference.

## Usage

To explore a specific design pattern, navigate to its corresponding package within the repository. Each package contains Java classes representing the components of the pattern, including interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete implementations. Additionally, accompanying documentation and examples are provided to illustrate the usage and benefits of each pattern.
