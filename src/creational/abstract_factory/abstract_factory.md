# Abstract Factory

## Description

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Example

In this example, we have implemented an abstract factory pattern to handle security-related objects in a backend system. We have two families of products: `AuthenticationHandler` and `TokenGenerator`.

- The `AuthenticationHandler` family provides different methods for user authentication, with concrete implementations such as `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler` and `OAuth2AuthenticationHandler`.
- The `TokenGenerator` family generates authentication tokens, with concrete implementations such as `SimpleTokenGenerator` and `JWTTokenGenerator`.

We define an abstract factory interface `SecurityFactory`, with methods to create `AuthenticationHandler` and `TokenGenerator` objects. Concrete factories (`UsernamePasswordSecurityFactory` and `OAuth2SecurityFactory`) implement this interface to create authentication handlers and token generators for their respective security methods.

The client code can use the abstract factory to create authentication handlers and token generators without being aware of their specific implementations, promoting flexibility and extensibility in the backend system.
