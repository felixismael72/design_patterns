# Interpreter

## Description

Interpreter is a behavioral design pattern that defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret and execute expressions in that language.

## Example

In this example, we'll illustrate the Interpreter pattern using a simple arithmetic expression language where users can evaluate expressions like "2 + 3 * 4" or "(5 - 2) * (8 / 4)".

### Implementation

- **MathExpression**: This is the abstract base class for all expression classes. It defines a method for interpreting expressions.

- **VariableExpression**: This is a concrete expression class that represents a variable value in the arithmetic expression language.

- **AdditionExpression**: This is another concrete expression class that represents an addition operation in the arithmetic expression language.

- **SubtractionExpression**: This is another concrete expression class that represents a subtraction operation in the arithmetic expression language.

- **MultiplicationExpression**: This is another concrete expression class that represents a multiplication operation in the arithmetic expression language.

- **DivisionExpression**: This is another concrete expression class that represents a division operation in the arithmetic expression language.

- **MathInterpreterContext**: This class contains the context for interpreting expressions, such as variable values or other contextual information.

- **Client**: This is the client class that constructs and evaluates arithmetic expressions using the interpreter.

### Usage

- Users construct arithmetic expressions using the provided expression classes, combining numeric values and arithmetic operations.

- The client evaluates the expressions by passing them to the interpreter along with a context containing variable values or other contextual information.

- The interpreter recursively evaluates the expressions according to the defined grammar and returns the result.

This example demonstrates how the Interpreter pattern can be used to define and interpret expressions in a simple arithmetic expression language.
